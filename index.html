                    <!-- STEP 1 -->
                    <h3>Step 1. Acquire a Contabo VPS</h3>
                    <p>Everyone knows that
                        <a href="https://contabo.com/">Contabo</a> is the number one source of premium virtual
                        private servers (and also the cheapest).</p>
                    <p>Find the nearest credit card from your parent's wallets and buy yourself a server. Look for
                        the one with the most ram
                        as that will enable you to sell the most servers.</p>
                    <p>When ordering, be sure to install Ubuntu 14.04, because 16.04 and 18.04 are newer, thus
                        consuming more of your valuable
                        RAM. We can't have that. Plus, our game server panel is fully compatible with 14.04.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 2 -->
                    <h3>Step 2. Set up SWAP</h3>
                    <p>SWAP is an amazin' technology that allows you to magically turn your hard drive into ram!
                        Yes, you heard that right.
                        You can turn your hard rive into ram. This works especially well with SCSI drives as they
                        are much faster than your
                        regular HDD.</p>
                    <p>Running out of ram? Just sell SWAP, it is just as good. Remember not to give this secret away
                        to anyone, including
                        your clients. If you ever run out of SCSI drives and are broke you can always use a USB
                        instead! checkout
                        <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/173676/how-to-make-a-usb-stick-swap-disk">this
                            guide</a> for instructions</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 3 -->
                    <h3>Step 3. Install Nulled WHMCS</h3>
                    <p>You're currently in the "testing phase", which means you have an excuse for using a nulled
                        copy of WHMCS. Google "Nulled
                        WHMCS" and click the first link that looks appealing.</p>
                    <p>Hopefully the website you're looking for has a shoutbox or chat, which means you can have
                        people guide you through
                        the entire install, including the part where ionCube doesn't work or when you find you
                        installed Php7.1 on top of
                        Php5.1.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 4 -->
                    <h3>Step 4. Install Pterodacley</h3>
                    <p>Pterodactylylee is the most important part of this since it's where you'll be hosting all of
                        your servers. We recommend
                        Pterodactil, for its ability to run more than one type of game server, and most importantly,
                        it's free.</p>
                    <p>You can head over to
                        <a href="https://pterodactyl.io">pterodacly.io</a> and click the Discord button, where you
                        can proceed to spam #support and call the panel trash to
                        get people to help you install it. This is the most crucial step so do it carefully. You can
                        also find a old installer
                        on youtube or google to do it for you. In this case the older Pterodactl will work fine for
                        making some quick money
                        on a budget. After all we don't have the $$$ for system admins, remember.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Warning:</b> If anyone tells you to remove the default Nginx config, whatever that is,
                        don't remove it as you'll need
                        it for your website to work properly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 5 -->
                    <h3>Step 5. Link WHMCS to Pterodacley</h3>
                    <p>You don't want to create servers manually, do you? Neither do I. Luckily for you, there's a
                        <b>free</b> WHMCS module available for hosts just like yours! Head into the #whmcs channel
                        in the Pterodactyl Discord
                        server you joined earlier and spam until someone sends you the download link.</p>
                    <p>Once you've done that, hire a sysadmin (or a web developer they're all the same) on
                        <a href="https://mc-market.org">MC-Market</a> to install it for you because you're "too
                        lazy". Once you find someone that's willing to install it
                        for $0.43, you can proceed to the next step. But wait, we need that money back from the two
                        year old you likely just
                        gave it to, so now lets open a PayPal dispute and use inspect element in our beowser to
                        change a few things around
                        on our evidence. Here's
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://www.allbusinesstemplates.com/api/download/?filecode=8X9SB">a
                            template</a> to get you past PayPal support (It's basically a free ticket)</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 6 -->
                    <h3>Step 6. Download a template</h3>
                    <p>Since no one actually wants to code a website, have a look around
                        <a href="https://themeforest.net">Themeforest</a> and find a Minecraft hosting template that
                        looks good.</p>
                    <p>Wait, WTF? This template is $9? You can't afford that! You're still in the "testing phase"!
                        Google "Themeforest
                        <code>Template Name Here</code> Template Nulled" and download them one by one until it
                        doesn't give you a virus. Upload it to your default Nginx
                        directory,
                        <code>/var/www/html/</code>, and edit away with notepad!</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Word of Advice:</b> Some people may suggest using something along the lines of Atom or
                        VSCode for editing your template.
                        Ignore them, Notepad is the fastest and most efficient editor on the market currently, and
                        it's built into Windows!</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 6.5 -->
                    <h3>Step 6 1/2. Customize your template</h3>
                    <p>The cheaper your services, the better, but you still want to make a profit. Since you're not
                        a registered host and
                        are still in the "testing phase", which means you don't have to pay taxes, I recommend
                        starting at $0.99/GB for base
                        pricing, to attract any potential customers that may have a sensitive budget, much like you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Be sure to also advertise your node specs boldly on the front page, and the DDoS protection
                        that you definitely have
                        (Cough, 480 GBps, cough, thats what all the good providers offer). Also, I would exaggerate
                        the node specs so customers
                        can proudly show off what they bought and don't think you're overselling, creating a sense
                        of pride and satisfaction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 7 -->
                    <h3>Step 7. Get a domain</h3>
                    <p>Every host has to have a domain to look good. You wouldn't want a free subdomain like
                        <code>explosivehosting.weebly.com</code> for your hosting, would you?</p>
                    <p>
                        <s>You're going to need one of your parent's credit card again for this step. Head over to
                            our special
                            <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/promos/amazing88s.aspx">Namecheap link</a> and pick
                            up yourself a .host domain, you can pick whatever you want. It's only $1 for the first
                            year, so they probably won't notice it go through.
                            <b>Be sure to enable auto-renewal for the domain so it won't suddenly stop working.</b>
                            Not like you're gonna be charged
                            $70 after that or anything.</s> Pftt, seriosuly, we don't even need that because our
                        servers are so good. Instead
                        check out
                        <a href="http://www.freenom.com">Freenom</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 8 -->
                    <h3>Step 8. Use Cloudflare</h3>
                    <p>The market is extremely competitive, so it is crucial not to give away your actual provider.
                        You wouldn't want your
                        competitors to find out your Contabo VPS, wouldn't you? Use Cloudflare to manage your domain
                        and turn that orange
                        cloud on.</p>
                    <p>Lie that you own the hardware. It is a good marketing strategy after all. If your clients are
                        somehow smart enough
                        to check the IP, just tell them you are collocating. Nothing can go wrong from there
                        &#x1F618;
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 9 -->
                    <h3>Step 9. Offer Discord Support</h3>
                    <p>WHMCS Tickets can be slow and annoying for customers, be sure to create a Discord server and
                        offer support there.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Word of Advice:</b> You may want to mute the support channel on your server as the
                        constant pinging can get annoying
                        while you're in lower school or watching YouTube.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 10 -->
                    <h3>Step 10. Advertise your host</h3>
                    <p>Now that you've got yourself a genuine Summer Hoax&trade;, it's time to advertise it on
                        <a href="https://mc-market.org">MC-Market</a>, the same place you hired your sysadmin from
                        earlier. A good suggestion is to also setup your territory
                        on planet minecraf and the minecraf fourms as well.</p>
                    <p>Before you do that though, you should hire a graphic designer from MC-Market to make you a
                        cool thread template design,
                        and then do a PayPal chargeback afterward. They don't really need the money at all, trust
                        me.</p>
                    <p>To get the most clients, search for "Minecraft server" in the search bar, and rapidly
                        copy/paste your thread template
                        <s>you paid for</s> you got earlier into the reply box on the page.</p>
                    <p>You may also want to go into the Hosting - Offering category and paste it there as well for
                        maximum effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 10 1/2 -->
                    <h3>Step 10 1/2. Create a logo</h3>
                    <p>How the hell do you expect your host to be recognised without a logo? It's the heart and soul of every SummerHoax&trade;.</p>
                    <p>First of all, download Microsoft PowerPoint if you don't have it already (if you don't you can get a cracked version free online - just search up <code>PowerPoint cracked free download online no virus</code> and click on the first link that looks appealing).</p>
                    <p>You're going to have to make your brand memorable, so I'd recommend adding a square, some clip art and your SummerHoax&trade;'s name in a popular font such as Comic Sans. Then open snipping tool and take a <s>high quality</s> 4K capture of your logo.</p>
                    <p>You can now add this logo to every single place on your website to make sure people know it's MineHost&trade; and not Enteron.</p>
                    <br>
                    <!-- STEP 11 -->
                    <h3>Step 11. Defend your host</h3>
                    <p>You may receive some backlash from the community in the form of negative reputation and
                        namecalling.</p>
                    <p>The hosting market is like the battlefield, you've gotta kill or get killed. Be sure to
                        deflect anything they throw
                        at you with insults, personal attacks (recommended), DDoS attacks, and other things that may
                        want to make them cry.
                        Offer to 1v1 them IRL too, that usually shuts them up pretty quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>A good example of someone doing this properly and effectively can be seen below:</p>

He created a host, played plenty of Unturned, and did god knows what else with his near-unlimited amount of cash. His mother? Blisfully unknowing she was losing thousands of dollars to her son's stupid decisions on the internet. At least, it didn't last for long.
